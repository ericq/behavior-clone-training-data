# behavior cloning training data
lap1 - trained from udacity workspace, slow but ok
lap 2 - trained from local simulator (windows env), pay attention to the image path in windows format
lap 3 - be no steering as much as possible, then sharp correction
lap 4 - run the bridge and the last half lap 3 times
lap 5 - teach how to drive back to the center.  youâ€™re still weaving back and forth between the middle of the road and the shoulder, but you need to turn off data recording when you weave out to the side, and turn it back on when you steer back to the middle.
lap 6 - post-bridge track back-n-forth
lap 7 - smooth drive in the center
